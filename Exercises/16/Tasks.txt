https://github.com/GoesToEleven/GolangTraining/tree/master/16_exercise-solutions

1.	Write a function which takes an integer. The function will have two returns. The first return should be the argument divided by 2. The second return should be a bool that let’s us know whether or not the argument was even. For example: 
    a.	half(1) returns (0, false)
    b.	half(2) returns (1, true)

2.	Modify the previous program to use a func expression.

3.	Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greatest number in a list of numbers.

4.	What's the value of this expression: (true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)?

5.	Write a function, foo, which can be called in all of these ways:

func main() {
    foo(1, 2)
    foo(1, 2, 3)
    aSlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    foo(aSlice...)
    foo()
}
